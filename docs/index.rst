=========================================

This is the documentation for the two guitar pedals built for the EWU IEEE club. 
There are two pedals: the 'Bazz Fuss' which takes a design sourced from homewrecker.com, and the 'Tremolo' pedal, which is a revised version of a design found in an instructables article.
